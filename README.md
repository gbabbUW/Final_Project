#What You Need to Know About Speed Dating

In this application the user is able to break down different facets of an experiment on speed dating conducted by the Columbia Business School during the years of 2002-2004.

The data collected contains all the attributes of thousands of different speed dates, including information such as the race, gender, sex, matches, careers/occupations, social life, and much more of each individual who took place in the experiment. From these numerous attributes, we analyze and present graphs showing how different attributes correlated with the outcome of speed dating, analyzing things like how careers/occupations have different effects on an individuals attribute rating and social life, how individuals of different races correlated with matching, and how individuals changed their beliefs about themselves and their peers over the course of the experiment.

The code is broken up into a library, data cleaning, UI, and server section which was used for their respective functions. The final product of the analysis can be found at the following link:
